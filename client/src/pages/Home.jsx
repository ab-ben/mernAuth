          Project Overview
        </h2>
        <div className="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-6">
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            This project leverages the powerful combination of MongoDB,
            Express.js, React, and Node.js to create a comprehensive
            authentication system. Users can register with their email and
            password, log in to their accounts, and even use Google OAuth for
            quick access. The application ensures secure data handling and
            provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            The backend is built with Express.js and Node.js, providing a robust
            and scalable server environment. MongoDB is used as the database to
            store user information securely. On the frontend, React is used to
            create a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Redux handles
            the state management efficiently.

          Why MongoDB?
        </h2>
        <div className="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-6">
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            MongoDB is chosen for this project due to its flexibility,
            scalability, and ease of integration with JavaScript applications.
            Here are some technical reasons why MongoDB is the best fit for our
            authentication system:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Schema Flexibility:</strong> MongoDB's document-based
              storage allows for a flexible schema design, which is ideal for
              evolving application requirements. This flexibility is
              particularly useful for storing user data, where fields might
              change over time.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Scalability:</strong> MongoDB is designed to scale
              horizontally by sharding, making it capable of handling large
              volumes of data and high-traffic loads. This ensures that the
              authentication system can grow with the user base without
              performance degradation.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>JSON-like Documents:</strong> MongoDB stores data in
              JSON-like BSON format, which aligns perfectly with the
              JavaScript-based MERN stack. This consistency in data format
              across the stack simplifies data handling and reduces the
              complexity of data transformation.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Robust Querying:</strong> MongoDB provides powerful query
              capabilities, including support for ad-hoc queries, indexing, and
              real-time aggregation. These features enhance the efficiency of
              querying user data and managing authentication processes.
